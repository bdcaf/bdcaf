  abstract: We analysed breath and inhaled room air samples from 39 healthy volunteers
    (28 non-smokers, 8 smokers and 3 ex-smokers) by SPME-GC-MS. Mixed expiratory and
    indoor air samples were collected in freshly cleaned Tedlar bags. Eighteen millilitres
    of each sample were transferred into sealed, evacuated glass vials, preconcentrated
    by solid-phase microextraction (SPME, carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane) and investigated
    by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS). For the unequivocal
    identification of potential marker compounds, pure calibration mixtures of reference
    compounds (depending on commercial availability) were prepared to determine the
    retention time and mass spectra with respect to our analytical setting. Applying
    the adapted SPME-GC/MS method with limit of detection in the high ppb range (0.05-15.00
    ppb), we succeeded in identifying altogether 38 compounds with concentrations
    in exhaled breath being at least 50% higher than concentration in inhaled air.
    From these 38 compounds, 31 were identified not only by the spectral library match
    but also by retention time of standards. A comparison of retention times and spectrum
    obtained for standards and determined compounds was performed. We found hydrocarbons
    (isoprene, 2-pentene, 2-methyl-1-pentene, benzene, toluene, p-cymene, limonene,
    2,4-dimethylheptane, n-butane), ketones (acetone, hydroxypropanone, methylvinyl
    ketone), ethers (dimethyl ether, 1,3-dioxolane), esters (ethyl acetate), aldehydes
    (propanal, hexanal, heptanal, acrolein) and alcohols (ethanol, 2-metoxyethanol,
    isopropyl alcohol, 2,2,3,3- tetramethylcyclopropanemethanol, 3,4-dimethylcyclohexanol).
    Proper identification of compounds in different cohorts of patients and volunteers
    is the base for further investigation of origin, biochemical background and distribution
    of potential breath biomarkers.

  abstract: Existing methods for the early detection of infections in mechanically
    ventilated (MV) patients at intensive care units (ICUs) are unsatisfactory. Here
    we present an exploratory study assessing the feasibility of breath VOC analyses
    for the non-invasive detection of pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of
    ventilated patients. An open uncontrolled clinical pilot study was performed by
    enrolling 28 mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with severe intracranial disease,
    being at risk for the development of or already with confirmed ventilation-associated
    pneumonia (VAP). The recently developed sampling technique enabled the collection
    of breath gas with a maximized contribution of alveolar air directly from the
    respiratory circuit under continuous capnography control, adsorptive preconcentration
    and final analysis by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).VAP
    was confirmed in 22/28 preselected patients (78%). The most common microorganisms
    were Staphylococcus aureus (5/22 VAP patients), Escherichia coli (5/22 VAP patients)
    and Candida spp. (5/22 VAP patients). 12/32 metabolites released by S. aureus
    in our previous in vitro studies were also detected in the end-tidal air of VAP
    patients infected with this pathogen. A similar overlap was seen in Candida albicans
    infections (8/29 VOCs). Moreover, the concentration profile of selected compounds
    correlated with the course of the infection.This prospective pilot study provides
    proof of the concept that the appearance and the concentration profile of pathogen-derived
    metabolites (elucidated from in vitro experiments) in the breath of ventilated
    patients during clinically confirmed VAP correlates with the presence of a particular
    pathogen.

  abstract: Non-invasive disease monitoring on the basis of volatile breath markers
    is a very attractive but challenging task. Several hundreds of compounds have
    been detected in exhaled air using modern analytical techniques (e.g. proton-transfer
    reaction mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and have even
    been linked to various diseases. However, the biochemical background for most
    of compounds detected in breath samples has not been elucidated; therefore, the
    obtained results should be interpreted with care to avoid false correlations.
    The major aim of this study was to assess the effects of smoking on the composition
    of exhaled breath. Additionally, the potential origin of breath volatile organic
    compounds (VOCs) is discussed focusing on diet, environmental exposure and biological
    pathways based on other’s studies. Profiles of VOCs detected in exhaled breath
    and inspired air samples of 115 subjects with addition of urine headspace derived
    from 50 volunteers are presented. Samples were analyzed with GC-MS after preconcentration
    on multibed sorption tubes in case of breath samples and solid phase micro-extraction
    (SPME) in the case of urine samples. Altogether 266 compounds were found in exhaled
    breath of at least 10% of the volunteers. From these, 162 compounds were identified
    by spectral library match and retention time (based on reference standards). It
    is shown that the composition of exhaled breath is considerably influenced by
    exposure to pollution and indoor-air contaminants and particularly by smoking.
    More than 80 organic compounds were found to be significantly related to smoking,
    the largest group comprising unsaturated hydrocarbons (29 dienes, 27 alkenes and
    3 alkynes). On the basis of the presented results, we suggest that for the future
    understanding of breath data it will be necessary to carefully investigate the
    potential biological origin of volatiles, e.g., by means of analysis of tissues,
    isolated cell lines or other body fluids. In particular, VOCs linked to smoking
    habit or being the results of human exposure should be considered with care for
    clinical diagnosis since small changes in their concentration profiles (typically
    in the ppt(v)-ppb(v) range) revealing that the outbreak of certain disease might
    be hampered by already high background.

  abstract: Proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and gas chromatography-mass
    spectrometry (GC-MS) methods were compared and used for determination of volatile
    organic compounds in breath of patients suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive
    pulmonary disease). The working ranges available in PTR-MS and GC-MS were 0.3-5.8
    nmol dm-3 and 0.9-1.8 nmol dm-3,respectively. Principal component analysis was
    used for comparison of sensitivity of PTR-MS and GC-MS towards particular compounds
    (alkanes, ketones and aldehydes).

  abstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) offer unique insights into ongoing biochemical
    processes in healthy and diseased humans. Yet, their diagnostic use is hampered
    by the limited understanding of their biochemical or cellular origin and their
    frequently unclear link to the underlying diseases. Major advancements are expected
    from the analyses of human primary cells, cell lines and cultures of microorganisms.
    In this review, a database of 125 reliably identified VOCs previously reported
    for human healthy and diseased cells was assembled and their potential origin
    is discussed. The majority of them have also been observed in studies with other
    human matrices (breath, urine, saliva, feces, blood, skin emanations). Moreover,
    continuing improvements of qualitative and quantitative analyses, based on the
    recommendations of the ISO-11843 guidelines, are suggested for the necessary standardization
    of analytical procedures and better comparability of results. The data provided
    contribute to arriving at a more complete human volatilome and suggest potential
    volatile biomarkers for future validation. Dedication:This review is dedicated
    to the memory of Prof. Dr. Anton Amann, who sadly passed away on January 6, 2015.
    He was motivator and motor for the field of breath research.

  abstract: 'Proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (PTR-TOFMS)
    exhibits high selectivity with a resolution of around 5000m/$\Delta$m. While isobars
    can be separated with this resolution, discrimination of isomeric compounds is
    usually not possible. The coupling of a multi-capillary column (MCC) with a PTR-TOFMS
    overcomes these problems as demonstrated in this paper for the ketone isomers
    3-heptanone and 2-methyl-3-hexanone and for different aldehydes. Moreover, fragmentation
    of compounds can be studied in detail which might even improve the identification.
    LODs for compounds tested are in the range of low ppbv and peak positions of the
    respective separated substances show good repeatability (RSD of the peak positions
    &lt;3.2%). Due to its special characteristics, such as isothermal operation, compact
    size, the MCC setup is suitable to be installed inside the instrument and the
    overall retention time for a complete spectrum is only a few minutes: this allows
    near real-time measurements in the optional MCC mode. In contrast to other methods
    that yield additional separation, such as the use of pre-cursor ions other than
    H3O(+), this method yields additional information without increasing complexity.'

  abstract: Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) provides an elegant approach
    for cancer screening and disease monitoring, whose use is currently limited by
    a lack of validated cancer-derived metabolites, which may serve as biomarkers.
    The aim of the experiments presented here was to investigate the release and consumption
    of VOCs from the non small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H1666, which was originally
    derived from a bronchoalveolar carcinoma.Following detachment by trypsinization
    suspended cells were incubated in a sealed fermenter for 21 hours. 200 ml of headspace
    from the cell culture were sampled, diluted with dry, highly purified air and
    preconcentrated by adsorption on three different solid sorbents with increasing
    adsorption strength. VOC-analysis was performed by thermodesorption-gas chromatography
    mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). In contrast to our previous studies experiments
    with NCI-H1666 cells only confirmed the consumption of several aldehydes, n-butyl
    acetate and the ethers methyl tert-butyl ether and ethyl tert-butyl ether, but
    no unequivocal release of VOCs was observed. Together with our previously published
    work these data indicate that the consumption of certain VOCs is commonly observed
    while their release shows cell line-restricted patterns, whose underlying causes
    are unknown.

  abstract: Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) is a new analytical
    technique for the real-time quantification of several trace gases simultaneously
    in air and breath. It relies on chemical ionization of the trace gas molecules
    in air/breath samples introduced into helium carrier gas using H(3)O(+), NO(+),
    and O(2) (+.) precursor ions. Reactions between the precursor ions and trace gas
    molecules proceed for an accurately defined time, the precursor and product ions
    being detected and counted by a downstream mass spectrometer, thus effecting quantification.
    Absolute concentrations of trace gases in single breath exhalation can be determined
    by SIFT-MS down to ppb levels, obviating sample collection and calibration. Illustrative
    examples of SIFT-MS studies include (i) analysis of gases from combustion engines,
    animals and their waste, and food; (ii) breath and urinary headspace studies of
    metabolites, ethanol metabolism, elevated acetone during ovulation, and exogenous
    compounds; and (iii) urinary infection and the presence of tumors, the influence
    of dialysis on breath ammonia, acetone, and isoprene, and acetaldehyde released
    by cancer cells in vitro. Flowing afterglow mass spectrometry (FA-MS) is briefly
    described, which allows on-line quantification of deuterium in breath water vapor.

  abstract: 'AIM: The aim of this work was to confirm the existence of volatile
    organic compounds (VOCs) specifically released by lung cancer cells. MATERIALS
    AND METHODS: NCI-H2087 cells were trypsinized and 100 x 10(6) cells were incubated
    in a sealed fermenter overnight. Samples from the headspace of the culture vessel
    were collected with simultaneous preconcentration by adsorption on solid sorbents
    and subsequently thermodesorbed for analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry
    (GC-MS). RESULTS: The results showed a significant increase in the concentration
    of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 2-methylpentane in the headspace as compared with medium
    controls. 2-Methylpentane is also found in exhaled breath of lung cancer patients
    in contrast to that from healthy volunteers. Statistically significantly lower
    abundances of acetaldehyde, 2-methylpropanal, 3-methylbutanal, 2-methylbutanal
    and butyl acetate were found. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that certain
    compounds can be cancer cell derived and thus may be indicative of the presence
    of a tumor. Some compounds were not released but seem to be consumed by cancer
    cells.'

  abstract: 'Context: The scent profile of human urine was investigated as potential
    source of chemical markers of human presence in collapsed buildings after natural
    or man-made disasters. Objective: The main goals of this study were to build a
    library of potential biomarkers of human urine to be used for the detection of
    entrapped victims and to further examine their evolution profile in time. Materials
    and methods: Headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
    (HS-SPME-GC-MS) was used to detect and identify the volatile organic compounds
    (VOCs) spontaneously released from urine of 20 healthy volunteers. Additionally,
    the evolution of human urine headspace during four days storage at room temperature
    was investigated. Results: 33 omnipresent species with incidence higher than 80%
    were selected as potential urine markers. The most represented chemical classes
    were ketones with 10 representatives, aldehydes (7 species) and sulfur compounds
    (7 species). The monitoring of the evolution of the urine scent demonstrated an
    increase in the emission of 26 omnipresent urinary volatiles (rise from 36% to
    526%). The highest increase was noted for dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide
    (fivefold increase) and 3-methyl-2-butanone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone and 3-hexanone
    (fourfold rise). Only three compounds exhibited decreasing trend; dimethylsulfone,
    octanal and propanal. Conclusion: The ubiquitous urine VOCs identified within
    this study create a library of potential markers of human urine to be verified
    in further field studies, involving portable and sensitive instruments, directly
    applied in the field.'

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Analysis of exhaled breath is a promising diagnostic method.
    Sampling of exhaled breath is non-invasive and can be performed as often as considered
    desirable. There are indications that the concentration and presence of certain
    of volatile compounds in exhaled breath of lung cancer patients is different from
    concentrations in healthy volunteers. This might lead to a future diagnostic test
    for lung cancer. METHODS: Exhaled breath samples from 65 patients with different
    stages of lung cancer and undergoing different treatment regimes were analysed.
    Mixed expiratory and indoor air samples were collected. Solid phase microextraction
    (SPME) with carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) sorbent was applied. Compounds
    were analysed by means of gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS).
    RESULTS: The method we used allowed identification with the spectral library of
    103 compounds showing at least 15% higher concentration in exhaled breath than
    in inhaled air. Among those 103 compounds, 84 were confirmed by determination
    of the retention time using standards based on the respective pure compound. Approximately,
    one third of the compounds detected were hydrocarbons. We found aromatic hydrocarbons,
    alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, sulfur compounds, nitrogen-containing
    compounds and halogenated compounds. Acetonitrile and benzene were two of 10 compounds
    which correlated with smoking behaviour. A comparison of results from cancer patients
    with those of 31 healthy volunteers revealed differences in the concentration
    and presence of certain compounds. The sensitivity for detection of lung cancer
    patients based on eight different compounds not seen in exhaled breath of healthy
    volunteers was 51% and the specificity was 100%. These eight potential markers
    for detection of lung cancer are 1-propanol, 2-butanone, 3-butyn-2-ol, benzaldehyde,
    2-methyl-pentane, 3-methyl-pentane, n-pentane and n-hexane. CONCLUSIONS: SPME
    is a relatively insensitive method and compounds not observed in exhaled breath
    may be present at a concentration lower than LOD. The main achievement of the
    present work is the validated identification of compounds observed in exhaled
    breath of lung cancer patients. This identification is indispensible for future
    work on the biochemical sources of these compounds and their metabolic pathways.'

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Europe
    and the western world. At present, diagnosis of lung cancer very often happens
    late in the course of the disease since inexpensive, non-invasive and sufficiently
    sensitive and specific screening methods are not available. Even though the CT
    diagnostic methods are good, it must be assured that “screening benefit outweighs
    risk, across all individuals screened, not only those with lung cancer”. An early
    non-invasive diagnosis of lung cancer would improve prognosis and enlarge treatment
    options. Analysis of exhaled breath would be an ideal diagnostic method, since
    it is non-invasive and totally painless. METHODS: Exhaled breath and inhaled room
    air samples were analyzed using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS)
    and solid phase microextraction with subsequent gas chromatography mass spectrometry
    (SPME-GCMS). For the PTR-MS measurements, 220 lung cancer patients and 441 healthy
    volunteers were recruited. For the GCMS measurements, we collected samples from
    65 lung cancer patients and 31 healthy volunteers. Lung cancer patients were in
    different disease stages and under treatment with different regimes. Mixed expiratory
    and indoor air samples were collected in Tedlar bags, and either analyzed directly
    by PTR-MS or transferred to glass vials and analyzed by gas chromatography mass
    spectrometry (GCMS). Only those measurements of compounds were considered, which
    showed at least a 15% higher concentration in exhaled breath than in indoor air.
    Compounds related to smoking behavior such as acetonitrile and benzene were not
    used to differentiate between lung cancer patients and healthy volunteers. RESULTS:
    Isoprene, acetone and methanol are compounds appearing in everybody’s exhaled
    breath. These three main compounds of exhaled breath show slightly lower concentrations
    in lung cancer patients as compared to healthy volunteers (p &lt; 0.01 for isoprene
    and acetone, p = 0.011 for methanol; PTR-MS measurements). A comparison of the
    GCMS-results of 65 lung cancer patients with those of 31 healthy volunteers revealed
    differences in concentration for more than 50 compounds. Sensitivity for detection
    of lung cancer patients based on presence of (one of) 4 different compounds not
    arising in exhaled breath of healthy volunteers was 52% with a specificity of
    100%. Using 15 (or 21) different compounds for distinction, sensitivity was 71%
    (80%) with a specificity of 100%. Potential marker compounds are alcohols, aldehydes,
    ketones and hydrocarbons. CONCLUSION: GCMS-SPME is a relatively insensitive method.
    Hence compounds not appearing in exhaled breath of healthy volunteers may be below
    the limit of detection (LOD). PTR-MS, on the other hand, does not need preconcentration
    and gives much more reliable quantitative results then GCMS-SPME. The shortcoming
    of PTR-MS is that it cannot identify compounds with certainty. Hence SPME-GCMS
    and PTR-MS complement each other, each method having its particular advantages
    and disadvantages. Exhaled breath analysis is promising to become a future non-invasive
    lung cancer screening method. In order to proceed towards this goal, precise identification
    of compounds observed in exhaled breath of lung cancer patients is necessary.
    Comparison with compounds released from lung cancer cell cultures, and additional
    information on exhaled breath composition in other cancer forms will be important.'

  abstract: The approach for breath-VOCs’ collection and preconcentration by applying
    needle traps was developed and optimized. The alveolar air was collected from
    only a few exhalations under visual control of expired CO(2) into a large gas-tight
    glass syringe and then warmed up to 45 °C for a short time to avoid condensation.
    Subsequently, a specially constructed sampling device equipped with Bronkhorst
    electronic flow controllers was used for automated adsorption. This sampling device
    allows time-saving collection of expired/inspired air in parallel onto three different
    needle traps as well as improvement of sensitivity and reproducibility of NT-GC-MS
    analysis by collection of relatively large (up to 150 ml) volume of exhaled breath.
    It was shown that the collection of alveolar air derived from only a few exhalations
    into a large syringe followed by automated adsorption on needle traps yields better
    results than manual sorption by up/down cycles with a 1 ml syringe, mostly due
    to avoided condensation and electronically controlled stable sample flow rate.
    The optimal profile and composition of needle traps consists of 2 cm Carbopack
    X and 1 cm Carboxen 1000, allowing highly efficient VOCs’ enrichment, while injection
    by a fast expansive flow technique requires no modifications in instrumentation
    and fully automated GC-MS analysis can be performed with a commercially available
    autosampler. This optimized analytical procedure considerably facilitates the
    collection and enrichment of alveolar air, and is therefore suitable for application
    at the bedside of critically ill patients in an intensive care unit. Due to its
    simplicity it can replace the time-consuming sampling of sufficient breath volume
    by numerous up/down cycles with a 1 ml syringe.

  abstract: 'ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The routinely used microbiological diagnosis
    of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is time consuming and often requires
    invasive methods for collection of human specimens (e.g. bronchoscopy). Therefore,
    it is of utmost interest to develop a non-invasive method for the early detection
    of bacterial infection in ventilated patients, preferably allowing the identification
    of the specific pathogens. The present work is an attempt to identify pathogen-derived
    volatile biomarkers in breath that can be used for early and non-invasive diagnosis
    of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). For this purpose, in vitro experiments
    with bacteria most frequently found in VAP patients, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus
    and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were performed to investigate the release or consumption
    of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). RESULTS: Headspace samples were collected
    and preconcentrated on multibed sorption tubes at different time points and subsequently
    analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As many as 32 and
    37 volatile metabolites were released by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively.
    Distinct differences in the bacteria-specific VOC profiles were found, especially
    with regard to aldehydes (e.g. acetaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal), which were taken
    up only by P. aeruginosa but released by S. aureus. Differences in concentration
    profiles were also found for acids (e.g. isovaleric acid), ketones (e.g. acetoin,
    2-nonanone), hydrocarbons (e.g. 2-butene, 1,10-undecadiene), alcohols (e.g. 2-methyl-1-propanol,
    2-butanol), esters (e.g. ethyl formate, methyl 2-methylbutyrate), volatile sulfur
    compounds (VSCs, e.g. dimethylsulfide) and volatile nitrogen compounds (VNCs,
    e.g. 3-methylpyrrole). Importantly, a significant VOC release was found already
    1.5 hours after culture start, corresponding to cell numbers of \~8\*106 \[CFUs/ml\].
    CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained provide strong evidence that the detection and
    perhaps even identification of bacteria could be achieved by determination of
    characteristic volatile metabolites, supporting the clinical use of breath-gas
    analysis as non-invasive method for early detection of bacterial lung infections.'

  abstract: 'Breath analysis for the purpose of non-invasive diagnosis of lung cancer
    has yielded numerous candidate compounds with still questionable clinical relevance.
    To arrive at suitable volatile organic compounds our approach combined the analysis
    of different sources: isolated tumor samples compared to healthy lung tissues,
    and exhaled breath from lung cancer patients and healthy controls. Candidate compounds
    were further compared to substances previously identified in the comparison of
    transformed and normal lung epithelial cell lines. For human studies, a breath
    sampling device was developed enabling automated and CO2-controlled collection
    of the end-tidal air. All samples were first preconcentrated on multibed sorption
    tubes and analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Significantly
    (p &lt; 0.05) higher concentrations in all three types of cancer samples studied
    were observed for ethanol and n-octane. Additional metabolites (inter alia 2-methylpentane,
    n-hexane) significantly released by lung cancer cells were observed at higher
    levels in cancer lung tissues and breath samples (compared to respective healthy
    controls) with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) only in breath samples.
    The results obtained confirmed the cancer-related origin of volatile metabolites,
    e.g. ethanol and octane that were both detected at significantly (p &lt; 0.05)
    elevated concentrations in all three kinds of cancer samples studied. This work
    is an important step towards identification of volatile breath markers of lung
    cancer through the demonstration of cancer-related origin of certain volatile
    metabolites.'

  abstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from or taken up by Streptococcus
    pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae cultures were analysed by means of GC-MS
    after adsorption of headspace samples on multi-bed sorption tubes. Sampling was
    performed at different time points during cultivation of bacteria to follow the
    dynamics of VOC metabolism. VOCs were identified not only by spectral library
    match but also based on retention times of native standards. As many as 34 volatile
    metabolites were released from S. pneumoniae and 28 from H. influenzae, comprising
    alcohols, aldehydes, esters, hydrocarbons, ketones and sulfur-containing compounds.
    For both species, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, methyl methacrylate, 2,3-butanedione
    and methanethiol were found in strongly elevated concentrations and 1-butanol
    and butanal in moderately elevated concentrations. In addition, characteristic
    volatile biomarkers were detected for both bacterial species and exclusively for
    S. pneumoniae, also catabolism of aldehydes (3-methylbutanal and hexanal) was
    found. The results obtained provide important input into the knowledge about volatile
    bacterial biomarkers, which may become particularly important for detection of
    pathogens in upper airways by breath-gas analysis in the future.

  abstract: Non-invasive disease monitoring on the basis of volatile breath markers
    is a very attractive but challenging task. Several hundreds of compounds have
    been detected in exhaled air using modern analytical techniques (e.g. proton-transfer
    reaction mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and have even
    been linked to various diseases. However, the biochemical background for most
    of compounds detected in breath samples has not been elucidated; therefore, the
    obtained results should be interpreted with care to avoid false correlations.
    The major aim of this study was to assess the effects of smoking on the composition
    of exhaled breath. Additionally, the potential origin of breath volatile organic
    compounds (VOCs) is discussed focusing on diet, environmental exposure and biological
    pathways based on other’s studies. Profiles of VOCs detected in exhaled breath
    and inspired air samples of 115 subjects with addition of urine headspace derived
    from 50 volunteers are presented. Samples were analyzed with GC-MS after preconcentration
    on multibed sorption tubes in case of breath samples and solid phase micro-extraction
    (SPME) in the case of urine samples. Altogether 266 compounds were found in exhaled
    breath of at least 10% of the volunteers. From these, 162 compounds were identified
    by spectral library match and retention time (based on reference standards). It
    is shown that the composition of exhaled breath is considerably influenced by
    exposure to pollution and indoor-air contaminants and particularly by smoking.
    More than 80 organic compounds were found to be significantly related to smoking,
    the largest group comprising unsaturated hydrocarbons (29 dienes, 27 alkenes and
    3 alkynes). On the basis of the presented results, we suggest that for the future
    understanding of breath data it will be necessary to carefully investigate the
    potential biological origin of volatiles, e.g., by means of analysis of tissues,
    isolated cell lines or other body fluids. In particular, VOCs linked to smoking
    habit or being the results of human exposure should be considered with care for
    clinical diagnosis since small changes in their concentration profiles (typically
    in the ppt(v)-ppb(v) range) revealing that the outbreak of certain disease might
    be hampered by already high background.

  abstract: This paper introduces the advanced breath analysis (ABA) platform, an
    innovative scientific research platform for the entire breath research domain.
    Within the ABA project, we are investigating novel data management concepts and
    semantic web technologies to document breath analysis studies for the long run
    as well as to enable their full automatic reproducibility. We propose several
    concept taxonomies (a hierarchical order of terms from a glossary of terms), which
    can be seen as a first step toward the definition of conceptualized terms commonly
    used by the international community of breath researchers. They build the basis
    for the development of an ontology (a concept from computer science used for communication
    between machines and/or humans and representation and reuse of knowledge) dedicated
    to breath research.

  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to confirm the existence of volatile
    organic compounds (VOCs) specifically released or consumed by lung cancer cells.
    METHODS: 50 million cells of the human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
    line CALU-1 were incubated in a sealed fermenter for 4 h or over night (18 hours).
    Then air samples from the headspace of the culture vessel were collected and preconcentrated
    by adsorption on solid sorbents with subsequent thermodesorption and analysis
    by means of gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Identification of altogether
    60 compounds in GCMS measurement was done not only by spectral library match,
    but also by determination of retention times established with calibration mixtures
    of the respective pure compounds. RESULTS: The results showed a significant increase
    in the concentrations of 2,3,3-trimethylpentane, 2,3,5-trimethylhexane, 2,4-dimethylheptane
    and 4-methyloctane in the headspace of CALU-1 cell culture as compared to medium
    controls after 18 h. Decreased concentrations after 18 h of incubation were found
    for acetaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal, butyl acetate, acetonitrile, acrolein, methacrolein,
    2-methylpropanal, 2-butanone, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane,
    and hexanal. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that certain volatile compounds
    can be cancer-cell derived and thus indicative of the presence of a tumor, whereas
    other compounds are not released but seem to be consumed by CALU-1 cells.'

  abstract: The aim of this study was to confirm the existence of volatile organic
    compounds (VOC) specifically released or consumed by the lung cancer cell line
    A549, which could be used in future screens as biomarkers for the early detection
    of lung cancer. For comparison, primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC)
    and human fibroblasts (hFB) were included. VOCs were detected in the headspace
    of cell cultures or medium controls following adsorption on solid sorbents, thermodesorption,
    and analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we
    identified VOCs that behaved similarly in normal and transformed cells. Thus,
    concentrations of 2-pentanone and 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene were found to increase
    in the headspace of A549, HBEpC, and hFB cell cultures. In addition, the ethers
    methyl tert-butyl ether and ethyl tert-butyl ether could be detected at elevated
    levels in the case of A549 cells and one of the untransformed cell lines. However,
    especially branched hydrocarbons and alcohols were seen increased more frequently
    in untransformed than A549 cells. A big variety of predominantly aldehydes and
    the ester n-butyl acetate were found at decreased concentrations in the headspace
    of all cell lines tested compared with medium controls. Again, more different
    aldehydes were found to be decreased in hFB and HBEpC cells compared with A549
    cells and 2-butenal was metabolized exclusively by both control cell lines. These
    data suggest that certain groups of VOCs may be preferentially associated with
    the transformed phenotype.

  abstract: Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) provides an elegant approach
    for cancer screening and disease monitoring, whose use is currently limited by
    a lack of validated cancer-derived metabolites, which may serve as biomarkers.
    The aim of the experiments presented here was to investigate the release and consumption
    of VOCs from the non small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H1666, which was originally
    derived from a bronchoalveolar carcinoma.Following detachment by trypsinization
    suspended cells were incubated in a sealed fermenter for 21 hours. 200 ml of headspace
    from the cell culture were sampled, diluted with dry, highly purified air and
    preconcentrated by adsorption on three different solid sorbents with increasing
    adsorption strength. VOC-analysis was performed by thermodesorption-gas chromatography
    mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). In contrast to our previous studies experiments
    with NCI-H1666 cells only confirmed the consumption of several aldehydes, n-butyl
    acetate and the ethers methyl tert-butyl ether and ethyl tert-butyl ether, but
    no unequivocal release of VOCs was observed. Together with our previously published
    work these data indicate that the consumption of certain VOCs is commonly observed
    while their release shows cell line-restricted patterns, whose underlying causes
    are unknown.

  abstract: 'Proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (PTR-TOFMS)
    exhibits high selectivity with a resolution of around 5000m/$\Delta$m. While isobars
    can be separated with this resolution, discrimination of isomeric compounds is
    usually not possible. The coupling of a multi-capillary column (MCC) with a PTR-TOFMS
    overcomes these problems as demonstrated in this paper for the ketone isomers
    3-heptanone and 2-methyl-3-hexanone and for different aldehydes. Moreover, fragmentation
    of compounds can be studied in detail which might even improve the identification.
    LODs for compounds tested are in the range of low ppbv and peak positions of the
    respective separated substances show good repeatability (RSD of the peak positions
    &lt;3.2%). Due to its special characteristics, such as isothermal operation, compact
    size, the MCC setup is suitable to be installed inside the instrument and the
    overall retention time for a complete spectrum is only a few minutes: this allows
    near real-time measurements in the optional MCC mode. In contrast to other methods
    that yield additional separation, such as the use of pre-cursor ions other than
    H3O(+), this method yields additional information without increasing complexity.'

  abstract: 'Breath analysis for the purpose of non-invasive diagnosis of lung cancer
    has yielded numerous candidate compounds with still questionable clinical relevance.
    To arrive at suitable volatile organic compounds our approach combined the analysis
    of different sources: isolated tumor samples compared to healthy lung tissues,
    and exhaled breath from lung cancer patients and healthy controls. Candidate compounds
    were further compared to substances previously identified in the comparison of
    transformed and normal lung epithelial cell lines. For human studies, a breath
    sampling device was developed enabling automated and CO2-controlled collection
    of the end-tidal air. All samples were first preconcentrated on multibed sorption
    tubes and analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Significantly
    (p &lt; 0.05) higher concentrations in all three types of cancer samples studied
    were observed for ethanol and n-octane. Additional metabolites (inter alia 2-methylpentane,
    n-hexane) significantly released by lung cancer cells were observed at higher
    levels in cancer lung tissues and breath samples (compared to respective healthy
    controls) with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) only in breath samples.
    The results obtained confirmed the cancer-related origin of volatile metabolites,
    e.g. ethanol and octane that were both detected at significantly (p &lt; 0.05)
    elevated concentrations in all three kinds of cancer samples studied. This work
    is an important step towards identification of volatile breath markers of lung
    cancer through the demonstration of cancer-related origin of certain volatile
    metabolites.'

  abstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) offer unique insights into ongoing biochemical
    processes in healthy and diseased humans. Yet, their diagnostic use is hampered
    by the limited understanding of their biochemical or cellular origin and their
    frequently unclear link to the underlying diseases. Major advancements are expected
    from the analyses of human primary cells, cell lines and cultures of microorganisms.
    In this review, a database of 125 reliably identified VOCs previously reported
    for human healthy and diseased cells was assembled and their potential origin
    is discussed. The majority of them have also been observed in studies with other
    human matrices (breath, urine, saliva, feces, blood, skin emanations). Moreover,
    continuing improvements of qualitative and quantitative analyses, based on the
    recommendations of the ISO-11843 guidelines, are suggested for the necessary standardization
    of analytical procedures and better comparability of results. The data provided
    contribute to arriving at a more complete human volatilome and suggest potential
    volatile biomarkers for future validation. Dedication:This review is dedicated
    to the memory of Prof. Dr. Anton Amann, who sadly passed away on January 6, 2015.
    He was motivator and motor for the field of breath research.

  abstract: The aim of this study was to confirm the existence of volatile organic
    compounds (VOC) specifically released or consumed by the lung cancer cell line
    A549, which could be used in future screens as biomarkers for the early detection
    of lung cancer. For comparison, primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC)
    and human fibroblasts (hFB) were included. VOCs were detected in the headspace
    of cell cultures or medium controls following adsorption on solid sorbents, thermodesorption,
    and analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Using this approach, we
    identified VOCs that behaved similarly in normal and transformed cells. Thus,
    concentrations of 2-pentanone and 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene were found to increase
    in the headspace of A549, HBEpC, and hFB cell cultures. In addition, the ethers
    methyl tert-butyl ether and ethyl tert-butyl ether could be detected at elevated
    levels in the case of A549 cells and one of the untransformed cell lines. However,
    especially branched hydrocarbons and alcohols were seen increased more frequently
    in untransformed than A549 cells. A big variety of predominantly aldehydes and
    the ester n-butyl acetate were found at decreased concentrations in the headspace
    of all cell lines tested compared with medium controls. Again, more different
    aldehydes were found to be decreased in hFB and HBEpC cells compared with A549
    cells and 2-butenal was metabolized exclusively by both control cell lines. These
    data suggest that certain groups of VOCs may be preferentially associated with
    the transformed phenotype.
