It is a space game where you construct your own vehicles and explore the solar system. As physics games go it is amazing.
Unless you carefully plan out maneuvers they will lead to disaster - which is often also hilarious to watch play out. Even getting into orbit is a challenge in the beginning.
My first Mun landing without breaking stuff. The only critic point would be that one needs to learn about most concepts outside the game.</description></item><item><title>atv dock</title><link>/post/2014/2014-08-13-atv-dock/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2014 19:42:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2014/2014-08-13-atv-dock/</guid><description>Coole Sache das Andockn von Georges Lemaitre</description></item></channel></rss>
