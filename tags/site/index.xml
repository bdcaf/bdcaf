      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having read some about the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt; package I thought I
could cleanup my site some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came up with some scripts to clean up tags.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I played around removing all the JavaScript dependencies of the hugo-academic template. I feel bootstrap and jQuery have little reason to be on such a simple site. By now I think I deviated from the original theme to no longer need it in the powered by section.
Anyway should you note something amiss - let me know.</description>

      <description>Now this site is on github pages.
I had already repos on github for some time and trusted it - only private repos I keep on other places. But mostly I was missing some features a bplaced so now the move. Mostly I like that I can now post new content via git so I just need to transfer new posts and not the whole site. That now the site is https secured is a nice boon.</description>

      <description>So the university is shutting down the personal home pages. Well it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal, though it was helpful that there was a server that would accept ssh connections.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with the free tier of bplaced. Which is basic but should suffice for my plain text pages.</description>
