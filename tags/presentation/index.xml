Keynote&lt;/a> to convert a tex presentation for convenient presenting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did have a presentation on my PhDs topic last week. Took me some
collecting data from recent paper drafts and old slides to create
something polished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you would expect I prepared the presentation in &lt;a href="https://github.com/josephwright/beamer">beamer latex&lt;/a>. I found the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matze/mtheme">metropolis template&lt;/a> to my liking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great was my shock as the slides would show up blurry in full screen -
well for the first second - and then &amp;ldquo;jump&amp;rdquo; to nicely rendered. I
tried in Preview as well as Skim. They would render nicely but still
slow in Acrobat Reader - however I don&amp;rsquo;t like that one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the last day I found my lifesaver: &lt;a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/freesoftware/pdftokeynote.html">PDF to
Keynote&lt;/a>.
Not only would it transfer my slides into sharp images, I then could
also use the fancy Keynote controls and the moderator screen for
notes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
