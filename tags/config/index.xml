      <description>Now this site is on github pages.
I had already repos on github for some time and trusted it - only private repos I keep on other places. But mostly I was missing some features a bplaced so now the move. Mostly I like that I can now post new content via git so I just need to transfer new posts and not the whole site. That now the site is https secured is a nice boon.</description>

      <description>Having most of my workflow on the commandline mailing my results using Tunderbird or Mail.app is sometimes quite a chore. I would rather do it from inside my workflow. mutt seems like a natural option. I also quite quickly considered alternatives like alpine - though since I prefer vim for my text editing I quickly decided against it.
offlineimap For mutt it quickly became aparent that I would need some external tool to fetch my mail.</description>
