Usually the problem is to obtain a nice corpus. Luckily PubMedWordCloud was recently updated and I had something to play with.
The initial cloud looks not good enough - I did not like how plurals are counted separately. Since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t clean it up easy enough I ended up going back to the tm package and roll my own script. Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s far from publishable.</description></item></channel></rss>
