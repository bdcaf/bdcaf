I had already repos on github for some time and trusted it - only private repos I keep on other places. But mostly I was missing some features a bplaced so now the move. Mostly I like that I can now post new content via git so I just need to transfer new posts and not the whole site. That now the site is https secured is a nice boon.</description></item></channel></rss>
