As I dig into &lt;code>R&lt;/code> I see they have an
&lt;a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting work flow
creating packages&lt;/a>. It addresses a
few important issues - tracking dependent packages,
documenting stuff and testing. Most important packaging and
installing on other systems can be done automatically using
a single command. I want that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found &lt;code>Makefiles&lt;/code> mentioned several times included in the
documentation - but so far haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how they are
supposed to be used. Eventually I decided to experiment
with an own project
&lt;a href="https://github.com/bdcaf/vignetteEngineMake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vignetteBuilderMake&lt;/a>.
It is not supposed to change anything in the core R package
process however it is intended to build vignettes using
&lt;code>make&lt;/code> while still allowing the nice features of the package
tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to try it out. A word of warning, once I
understand the process better I hope I can make a better
suited package.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
