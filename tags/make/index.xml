      <description>I am quite confident using make to create complex reports. As I dig into R I see they have an interesting work flow creating packages. It addresses a few important issues - tracking dependent packages, documenting stuff and testing. Most important packaging and installing on other systems can be done automatically using a single command. I want that.
I found Makefiles mentioned several times included in the documentation - but so far haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how they are supposed to be used.</description>
