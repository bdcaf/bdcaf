Even in the
simplistic way I know - already helpful. Like in this
&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xkcd&lt;/a>
&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" alt="xkcd comic">&lt;/a> It
is not easy finding good exercises to improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got pointed to
&lt;a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learngitbranching&lt;/a>. It looks
polished and the exercises are short enough to do between. Just
somehow I overlooked the commandos &lt;code>reset&lt;/code> and &lt;code>undo&lt;/code> to restart the
exercised.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nice stuff from uibk</title><link>/post/2017/2017-04-22-uibkserv/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2017 10:54:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>/post/2017/2017-04-22-uibkserv/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I was checking whether the uibk would offer us some storage for
&lt;a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git&lt;/a> projects I was positively surprised they run
a full
&lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gitlab&lt;/a> instance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately we will be limited to 50 projects - so I will not be able
to abandon my bitbucket account. Anyway nice to be able to host
potentially sensitive stuff internal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also they run
&lt;a href="https://mattermost.uibk.ac.at/breath-research/channels/town-square" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mattermost&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>now that looks very interesting. Chatting without going through american
services&amp;hellip; Need to get my friends in there.&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cookiecutter&lt;/a> templates for
my data analysis work flow is finally in a state that I can show the
world. You can get it from
&lt;a href="https://github.com/bdcaf/cookiecutter-r-data-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github&lt;/a>.
All in all it is my way to setup a &lt;em>reproducible research work flow&lt;/em> -
for too long I have just copied files around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is all about using external tools in addition to
&lt;a href="https://r-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R&lt;/a>. The most essential being
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make&lt;/a>. I am very proud about the
makefile that keeps code and data directories clean. I am still
considering to name the directories differently - but I have used this
scheme for so long that it has become my second nature. Also the way
make tracks dependencies between code and data helps me keep sane in
more complex analysis work flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The longest I spent on getting
&lt;a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knitr&lt;/a>
respect the directory layout on which I insist. But finally it seems
to obey me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am looking forward how it will speed up my setup.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
