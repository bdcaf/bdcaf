      <description>As I was checking whether the uibk would offer us some storage for git projects I was positively surprised they run a full gitlab instance.
Unfortunately we will be limited to 50 projects - so I will not be able to abandon my bitbucket account. Anyway nice to be able to host potentially sensitive stuff internal.
Also they run mattermost - now that looks very interesting. Chatting without going through american services&amp;hellip; Need to get my friends in there.</description>

      <description>Having most of my workflow on the commandline mailing my results using Tunderbird or Mail.app is sometimes quite a chore. I would rather do it from inside my workflow. mutt seems like a natural option. I also quite quickly considered alternatives like alpine - though since I prefer vim for my text editing I quickly decided against it.
offlineimap For mutt it quickly became aparent that I would need some external tool to fetch my mail.</description>
