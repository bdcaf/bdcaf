Tunderbird or Mail.app is sometimes quite a chore. I would rather do
it from inside my workflow.
&lt;a href="http://www.mutt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mutt&lt;/a> seems like a
natural option. I also quite quickly considered alternatives like
&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/alpine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alpine&lt;/a> - though since I prefer
vim for my text editing I quickly decided against it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="offlineimap">offlineimap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For mutt it quickly became aparent that I would need some external
tool to fetch my mail. Many sites describe
&lt;a href="http://www.offlineimap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offlineimap&lt;/a> though as the maintainer
put a message that he moved on to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/imapfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imapfw&lt;/a> I was worried. Also
my first attempt didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so I quickly decided I wanted to go
with a &amp;ldquo;maintained&amp;rdquo; project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So ultimately I ended at
&lt;a href="http://isync.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isync&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initial configurations that I frankensteined together didn&amp;rsquo;t work
either so I had to go on debugging.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="certificate-woes">certificate woes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I immediately got certificate errors. Even for google. In the
configuration the have a commented line for certificates in the home
directory. So I decided to get them for myself. Since I am behind
the universities firewall in the same subnet as the mail servers I was
not to worried that someone might MITM me bad certs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short I used&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>[~]$ openssl s_client -connect mailserver.uni.ac.at:993 -showcerts &amp;gt; crt
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>to download them. Basically I replace mailserver.uni.ac.at with my
servers. Then I used trusty old vim to cut the blocks from
&lt;code> -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/code> down to &lt;code>-----END CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/code>
(including those lines) into individual files which I named based on
the identification before the blocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="passwords">passwords&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Along with this certificate issues I noticed that passwords often are
put in plain text in the config files. An absolute no-go for me. I
quickly discovered
&lt;a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass&lt;/a> which uses
gpg to encrypt them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure still worried as these are then passed around in plain text - but
at least I will not have them in my repositories on github.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="oh-gmail">oh gmail&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>since most tutorials explicitely explain how to set up gmail I was
confused why it just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work for me!
It just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t accept the password. After long and useless research
I recalled something was changed by google. You can now
&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create
passwords for less secure
apps&lt;/a> - and that
was it. All I had to do was create an app password on the linked
site. Nice - so now even in the encrypted store is my google password
and I can easily delete the one for the app.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="final-config">final config&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>so this is what is in my &lt;code>.mbsyncrc&lt;/code>. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to post it as big
text block as one needs to fill in the values that fit ones setup.&lt;/p>

IMAPStore gmail-remote

MaildirStore gmail-local
Path ~/Archive/Mail/Gmail/
Inbox ~/Archive/Mail/Gmail/Inbox
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>though it was essential to create the folders using
&lt;code>mkdir -p ~/Archive/Mail/Gmail&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and finally &lt;code>mbsync uibk gmail&lt;/code> will work without error.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Gotta leave this for now. I see there is an issue with cron on Mac.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wow this got quite some post. I will describe how to set up mutt next
time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
