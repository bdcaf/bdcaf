      <description>Exhaled concentration of inert gases simply depends on the inhaled concentration. Especially in steady state it is obvious that exhaled concentration needs to be equal to the inhaled concentration. In the case of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that take part in the metabolism the relationship becomes more complicated. The exhaled concentration then also depends on metabolic production and metabolization rates.
We consider the concentration in steady state. We already know that exhaled concentration is a linear function of inhaled concentration, fully described by two numbers - slope and intercept.</description>

      <title>Metabolization of deuterated ethanol</title>

      <description>Although deuterated molecules appear in nature the full deuteration appear only at practically non-detectable level. These molecules are therefore not of endogenous origin. Considering safety deuterium is not radioactive and behaves chemically like regular hydrogene.
Despite the metabolic pathway for ethanol degradation being well understood its parameter are not easy to measure. The main reason is that these pathways are also permanently active in other metabolic contexts. Therefore observing deuterated molecules not appearing in nature and their metabolites is a promising method for observation.</description>
