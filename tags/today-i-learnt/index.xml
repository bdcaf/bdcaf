Till yesterday it started acting up during update and even messed up already installed plugins. After some messing around I admitted I will not be able to solve it easily so I tried to give the new builtin package manager a try. I followed this post. And it seems to work like a charm, also within nvim.
I added all my packages using git submodule add in directories like pack/git/start and pack/helper/opt.</description></item><item><title>Readline</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/2018/01/23/readline/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2018 17:55:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/2018/01/23/readline/</guid><description>In many terminal programs readline is doing the editing of input. It is possible with M-v to quickly switch to vi mode and with M-e to the default emacs mode. In emacs mode one has a few commands like ^A to jump to the begin of line. Usually I prefer vi - but in command line it&amp;rsquo;s not that useful to switch modes.
R in tmux got stuck in vi mode and was pasting ^A^K.</description></item></channel></rss>
