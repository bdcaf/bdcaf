abstract: 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major
cause of death worldwide. Acute exacerbations (AECOPD), caused by
infectious and non-infectious agents, contribute to an increase in
mortality. The diagnostic procedure of AECOPD is mainly based on
clinical features. The aim of this pilot study was to identify whether
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath could be used to
discriminate for acute exacerbated COPD. Three patient groups
were included in this controlled study: AECOPD patients (n= 14, age
mean ± SD: 71.4 ± 7.46), stable COPD patients (n= 16, age mean ± SD:
66.9 ± 9.05) and healthy volunteers (n= 24, age mean ± SD: 28 ± 6.08).
Breath samples were collected by optimizing a sampling strategy
developed by us. These samples were then analyzed using a thermal
desorption – gas chromatography – time of flight – mass spectrometer
(TD-GC-ToF-MS). A total 105 VOCs were identified in the breath
samples. Relevant substances were subsequently selected by overall
occurrence rate, the frequency of positive alveolar gradient (i.e. the
difference in exhaled and inhaled VOCs concentration), exclusion of
"smoking related" VOCs and significant differences in alveolar
gradients between the three groups. These steps dramatically reduced
the number of relevant analytes and resulted in 12 key VOCs having
discriminative value. The performance of patients''  classification
described by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve using
all 12 substances delineates an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. A
further reduction to 4 VOCs (alveolar gradients only different between
AECOPD and COPD) delineates an AUC of 0.92. These results indicate
that breath analysis with TD-GC-ToF-MS holds promise for an accurate
and easy to perform differential diagnosis between AECOPD and COPD. In
this regard, ketones were observed at the highest levels in exhaled
breath of AECOPD, some of which are also related to potential
bacterial pathogens. Using a set of VOCs that can discriminate for
AECOPD, the calculated AUCs in ROC curve analysis show far superior
results in comparison to serum AECOPD biomarkers, such as C-reactive
protein. The identified VOCs should be further investigated in
translational studies addressing their potential for developing highly
specific nanosensors for breath gas analysis which would give
clinicians a tool for non-invasive diagnosis of AECOPD at the point of
care.'
