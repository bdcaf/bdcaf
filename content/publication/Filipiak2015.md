abstract: Existing methods for the early detection of infections in mechanically
  ventilated (MV) patients at intensive care units (ICUs) are unsatisfactory. Here
  we present an exploratory study assessing the feasibility of breath VOC analyses
  for the non-invasive detection of pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of
  ventilated patients. An open uncontrolled clinical pilot study was performed by
  enrolling 28 mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with severe intracranial disease,
  being at risk for the development of or already with confirmed ventilation-associated
  pneumonia (VAP). The recently developed sampling technique enabled the collection
  of breath gas with a maximized contribution of alveolar air directly from the
  respiratory circuit under continuous capnography control, adsorptive preconcentration
  and final analysis by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).VAP
  was confirmed in 22/28 preselected patients (78%). The most common microorganisms
  were Staphylococcus aureus (5/22 VAP patients), Escherichia coli (5/22 VAP patients)
  and Candida spp. (5/22 VAP patients). 12/32 metabolites released by S. aureus
  in our previous in vitro studies were also detected in the end-tidal air of VAP
  patients infected with this pathogen. A similar overlap was seen in Candida albicans
  infections (8/29 VOCs). Moreover, the concentration profile of selected compounds
  correlated with the course of the infection.This prospective pilot study provides
  proof of the concept that the appearance and the concentration profile of pathogen-derived
  metabolites (elucidated from in vitro experiments) in the breath of ventilated
  patients during clinically confirmed VAP correlates with the presence of a particular
  pathogen.
