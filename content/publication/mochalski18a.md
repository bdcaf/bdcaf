  The presence of certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of patients with gastric cancer has been reported by a number of research groups; however, the source of these compounds remains controversial. Comparison of VOCs emitted from gastric cancer tissue to those emitted from non-cancerous tissue would help in understanding which of the VOCs are associated with gastric cancer and provide a deeper knowledge on their generation. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) coupled with head-space needle trap extraction (HS-NTE) as the pre-concentration technique, was used to identify and quantify VOCs released by gastric cancer and non-cancerous tissue samples collected from 41 patients during surgery. Excluding contaminants, a total of 32 VOCs were liberated by the tissue samples. The emission of four of them (carbon disulfide, pyridine, 3-methyl-2-butanone and 2-pentanone) was significantly higher from cancer tissue, whereas three compounds (isoprene, ?-butyrolactone and dimethyl sulfide) were in greater concentration from the non-cancerous tissues (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the levels of three VOCs (2-methyl-1-propene, 2-propenenitrile and pyrrole) were correlated with the occurrence of H. pylori; and four compounds (acetonitrile, pyridine, toluene and 3-methylpyridine) were associated with tobacco smoking. Ex vivo analysis of VOCs emitted by human tissue samples provides a unique opportunity to identify chemical patterns associated with a cancerous state and can be considered as a complementary source of information on volatile biomarkers found in breath, blood or urine.
