abstract = "Proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods were compared and used for determination of volatile organic compounds in breath of patients suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The working ranges available in PTR-MS and GC-MS were 0.3-5.8 nmol dm(-3) and 0.9-1.8 nmol dm(-3), respectively. Principal component analysis was used for comparison of sensitivity of PTR-MS and GC-MS towards particular compounds (alkanes, ketones and aldehydes)."
