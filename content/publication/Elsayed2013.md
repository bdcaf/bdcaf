abstract: This paper introduces the advanced breath analysis (ABA) platform, an
  innovative scientific research platform for the entire breath research domain.
  Within the ABA project, we are investigating novel data management concepts and
  semantic web technologies to document breath analysis studies for the long run
  as well as to enable their full automatic reproducibility. We propose several
  concept taxonomies (a hierarchical order of terms from a glossary of terms), which
  can be seen as a first step toward the definition of conceptualized terms commonly
  used by the international community of breath researchers. They build the basis
  for the development of an ontology (a concept from computer science used for communication
  between machines and/or humans and representation and reuse of knowledge) dedicated
  to breath research.
