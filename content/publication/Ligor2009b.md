abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Analysis of exhaled breath is a promising diagnostic method.
  Sampling of exhaled breath is non-invasive and can be performed as often as considered
  desirable. There are indications that the concentration and presence of certain
  of volatile compounds in exhaled breath of lung cancer patients is different from
  concentrations in healthy volunteers. This might lead to a future diagnostic test
  for lung cancer. METHODS: Exhaled breath samples from 65 patients with different
  stages of lung cancer and undergoing different treatment regimes were analysed.
  Mixed expiratory and indoor air samples were collected. Solid phase microextraction
  (SPME) with carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) sorbent was applied. Compounds
  were analysed by means of gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS).
  RESULTS: The method we used allowed identification with the spectral library of
  103 compounds showing at least 15% higher concentration in exhaled breath than
  in inhaled air. Among those 103 compounds, 84 were confirmed by determination
  of the retention time using standards based on the respective pure compound. Approximately,
  one third of the compounds detected were hydrocarbons. We found aromatic hydrocarbons,
  alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, sulfur compounds, nitrogen-containing
  compounds and halogenated compounds. Acetonitrile and benzene were two of 10 compounds
  which correlated with smoking behaviour. A comparison of results from cancer patients
  with those of 31 healthy volunteers revealed differences in the concentration
  and presence of certain compounds. The sensitivity for detection of lung cancer
  patients based on eight different compounds not seen in exhaled breath of healthy
  volunteers was 51% and the specificity was 100%. These eight potential markers
  for detection of lung cancer are 1-propanol, 2-butanone, 3-butyn-2-ol, benzaldehyde,
  2-methyl-pentane, 3-methyl-pentane, n-pentane and n-hexane. CONCLUSIONS: SPME
  is a relatively insensitive method and compounds not observed in exhaled breath
  may be present at a concentration lower than LOD. The main achievement of the
  present work is the validated identification of compounds observed in exhaled
  breath of lung cancer patients. This identification is indispensible for future
  work on the biochemical sources of these compounds and their metabolic pathways.'
