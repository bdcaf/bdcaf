abstract: Non-invasive disease monitoring on the basis of volatile breath markers
  is a very attractive but challenging task. Several hundreds of compounds have
  been detected in exhaled air using modern analytical techniques (e.g. proton-transfer
  reaction mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and have even
  been linked to various diseases. However, the biochemical background for most
  of compounds detected in breath samples has not been elucidated; therefore, the
  obtained results should be interpreted with care to avoid false correlations.
  The major aim of this study was to assess the effects of smoking on the composition
  of exhaled breath. Additionally, the potential origin of breath volatile organic
  compounds (VOCs) is discussed focusing on diet, environmental exposure and biological
  pathways based on other’s studies. Profiles of VOCs detected in exhaled breath
  and inspired air samples of 115 subjects with addition of urine headspace derived
  from 50 volunteers are presented. Samples were analyzed with GC-MS after preconcentration
  on multibed sorption tubes in case of breath samples and solid phase micro-extraction
  (SPME) in the case of urine samples. Altogether 266 compounds were found in exhaled
  breath of at least 10% of the volunteers. From these, 162 compounds were identified
  by spectral library match and retention time (based on reference standards). It
  is shown that the composition of exhaled breath is considerably influenced by
  exposure to pollution and indoor-air contaminants and particularly by smoking.
  More than 80 organic compounds were found to be significantly related to smoking,
  the largest group comprising unsaturated hydrocarbons (29 dienes, 27 alkenes and
  3 alkynes). On the basis of the presented results, we suggest that for the future
  understanding of breath data it will be necessary to carefully investigate the
  potential biological origin of volatiles, e.g., by means of analysis of tissues,
  isolated cell lines or other body fluids. In particular, VOCs linked to smoking
  habit or being the results of human exposure should be considered with care for
  clinical diagnosis since small changes in their concentration profiles (typically
  in the ppt(v)-ppb(v) range) revealing that the outbreak of certain disease might
  be hampered by already high background.
