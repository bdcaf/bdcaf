abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The routinely used microbiological diagnosis
  of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is time consuming and often requires
  invasive methods for collection of human specimens (e.g. bronchoscopy). Therefore,
  it is of utmost interest to develop a non-invasive method for the early detection
  of bacterial infection in ventilated patients, preferably allowing the identification
  of the specific pathogens. The present work is an attempt to identify pathogen-derived
  volatile biomarkers in breath that can be used for early and non-invasive diagnosis
  of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). For this purpose, in vitro experiments
  with bacteria most frequently found in VAP patients, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus
  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were performed to investigate the release or consumption
  of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). RESULTS: Headspace samples were collected
  and preconcentrated on multibed sorption tubes at different time points and subsequently
  analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As many as 32 and
  37 volatile metabolites were released by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively.
  Distinct differences in the bacteria-specific VOC profiles were found, especially
  with regard to aldehydes (e.g. acetaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal), which were taken
  up only by P. aeruginosa but released by S. aureus. Differences in concentration
  profiles were also found for acids (e.g. isovaleric acid), ketones (e.g. acetoin,
  2-nonanone), hydrocarbons (e.g. 2-butene, 1,10-undecadiene), alcohols (e.g. 2-methyl-1-propanol,
  2-butanol), esters (e.g. ethyl formate, methyl 2-methylbutyrate), volatile sulfur
  compounds (VSCs, e.g. dimethylsulfide) and volatile nitrogen compounds (VNCs,
  e.g. 3-methylpyrrole). Importantly, a significant VOC release was found already
  1.5 hours after culture start, corresponding to cell numbers of \~8\*106 \[CFUs/ml\].
  CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained provide strong evidence that the detection and
  perhaps even identification of bacteria could be achieved by determination of
  characteristic volatile metabolites, supporting the clinical use of breath-gas
  analysis as non-invasive method for early detection of bacterial lung infections.'
