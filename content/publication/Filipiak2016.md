abstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) offer unique insights into ongoing biochemical
  processes in healthy and diseased humans. Yet, their diagnostic use is hampered
  by the limited understanding of their biochemical or cellular origin and their
  frequently unclear link to the underlying diseases. Major advancements are expected
  from the analyses of human primary cells, cell lines and cultures of microorganisms.
  In this review, a database of 125 reliably identified VOCs previously reported
  for human healthy and diseased cells was assembled and their potential origin
  is discussed. The majority of them have also been observed in studies with other
  human matrices (breath, urine, saliva, feces, blood, skin emanations). Moreover,
  continuing improvements of qualitative and quantitative analyses, based on the
  recommendations of the ISO-11843 guidelines, are suggested for the necessary standardization
  of analytical procedures and better comparability of results. The data provided
  contribute to arriving at a more complete human volatilome and suggest potential
  volatile biomarkers for future validation. Dedication:This review is dedicated
  to the memory of Prof. Dr. Anton Amann, who sadly passed away on January 6, 2015.
  He was motivator and motor for the field of breath research.
