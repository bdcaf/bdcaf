abstract: Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) provides an elegant approach
  for cancer screening and disease monitoring, whose use is currently limited by
  a lack of validated cancer-derived metabolites, which may serve as biomarkers.
  The aim of the experiments presented here was to investigate the release and consumption
  of VOCs from the non small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H1666, which was originally
  derived from a bronchoalveolar carcinoma.Following detachment by trypsinization
  suspended cells were incubated in a sealed fermenter for 21 hours. 200 ml of headspace
  from the cell culture were sampled, diluted with dry, highly purified air and
  preconcentrated by adsorption on three different solid sorbents with increasing
  adsorption strength. VOC-analysis was performed by thermodesorption-gas chromatography
  mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). In contrast to our previous studies experiments
  with NCI-H1666 cells only confirmed the consumption of several aldehydes, n-butyl
  acetate and the ethers methyl tert-butyl ether and ethyl tert-butyl ether, but
  no unequivocal release of VOCs was observed. Together with our previously published
  work these data indicate that the consumption of certain VOCs is commonly observed
  while their release shows cell line-restricted patterns, whose underlying causes
  are unknown.
