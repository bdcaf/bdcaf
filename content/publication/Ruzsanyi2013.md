abstract: 'Proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (PTR-TOFMS)
  exhibits high selectivity with a resolution of around 5000m/$\Delta$m. While isobars
  can be separated with this resolution, discrimination of isomeric compounds is
  usually not possible. The coupling of a multi-capillary column (MCC) with a PTR-TOFMS
  overcomes these problems as demonstrated in this paper for the ketone isomers
  3-heptanone and 2-methyl-3-hexanone and for different aldehydes. Moreover, fragmentation
  of compounds can be studied in detail which might even improve the identification.
  LODs for compounds tested are in the range of low ppbv and peak positions of the
  respective separated substances show good repeatability (RSD of the peak positions
  &lt;3.2%). Due to its special characteristics, such as isothermal operation, compact
  size, the MCC setup is suitable to be installed inside the instrument and the
  overall retention time for a complete spectrum is only a few minutes: this allows
  near real-time measurements in the optional MCC mode. In contrast to other methods
  that yield additional separation, such as the use of pre-cursor ions other than
  H3O(+), this method yields additional information without increasing complexity.'
