I played around removing all the JavaScript dependencies of the
hugo-academic template.  I feel bootstrap and jQuery have little
reason to be on such a simple site.  By now I think I deviated from
the original theme to no longer need it in the powered by section.

Anyway should you note something amiss - let me know.
