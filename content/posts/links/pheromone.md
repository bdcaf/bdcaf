"BBC in our time" had a good [podcast about pheromones](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002mdl).  Too bad they don't offer transcripts.

Pheromones in breath would be most interesting however it is still in debate whether human pheromones exist at all.  
But there was the discovery of rabbit mammary pheromone  by [Schaal et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01739).  And the [darcin pheromone in mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2890510/).
I did learn that some animals also have another organ related to smell - the [vomeronasal organ (Jacobson's organ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal_organ).  It seems to be also present in humans.

Unfortunately our tech still doesn't perform to well at the relevant masses, though that is an most interesting research area.
