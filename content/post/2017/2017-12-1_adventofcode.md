There is an advent calendar for grown ups this year. [`advent of
code`](http://adventofcode.com/2017) gives every day a nice challenge.
This year I try to remember what I learnt of Haskell.   The
leader board is a bit annoying as it is completely filled with people
that manage to solve the problems in seconds (the problems are
released at midnight EST).

Still they are worth checking out.
