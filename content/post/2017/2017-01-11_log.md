title: Article about LOQ

Just got [Imputing defensible values for left-censored ‘below level of
quantitation’ (LoQ) biomarker
measurements](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1752-7155/10/4/045001) forwarded.  It
starts as interesting read stating the problem but IMHO ultimatively fails to
address the problem.
I am especially disappointed that neither the IUPAC definition and guidelines
are mentioned, nor the current ISO 11843.  Especially the works of [Lloyd A.
Currie](https://scholar.google.at/scholar?q=lloyd+a+currie) offer great insight 
in this topic.

The whole idea of censoring values below LOQ was already debunked by Currie.
While I find the whole censored data method is promising I expect it useful for
cases where the measurement device reaches its limits - not cases of manual
censorship.
