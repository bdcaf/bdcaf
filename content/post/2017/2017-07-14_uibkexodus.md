So the university is shutting down the personal home pages.
Well it's no big deal, though it was helpful that there was a
server that would accept ssh connections. 

Now I'm experimenting with the free tier of
[bplaced](http://www.bplaced.net).  Which is basic but
should suffice for my plain text pages.
