[RAND corporation](https://www.rand.org) has released some of their
classics freely at [RAND
Classics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/classics.html).  I did already
know [The Compleat
Strategyst](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB113-1.html)
which is a classic.  There are some more game theory books that I
don't know yet.  And lots of cold war strategy - all worth a look.
