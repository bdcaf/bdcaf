Every now and then I look up the games from my past.  It is amazing
that there are now archives of these ancient games online.  Today I
discovered [myabandoneware](https://www.myabandonware.com) like the
[internet archive](https://arvchive.org) they not only have the
downloads - but also a player where you can play in the browser
window.  Not so nice for new games but for the ancient ones I did
remember amazing.
