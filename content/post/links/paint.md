There now is a Javascript recreation of Windows Paint:
[Paint.js](http://jspaint.ml/).  

While Paint is easily the worst graphics program I used to work it is
familiar to almost anyone.  I still see way too many graphics in
papers that were touched up by paint.  This will make sure another
generation of researchers can learn this dreaded tool.
