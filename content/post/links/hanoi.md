The youtuber [3blue1brown][1] has a number of interesting posts.  however often he is a bit fast for me and it seems handwaving.

Recently he made a fantastic video about solving the [towers of hanoi][2].  I did already know it is easy to spell out the solution in terms of recursion.  However he showed some connection to binary and ternary numbers - which alone is funny.  And finally that the solution also traverses the Sierpinsky triangle in [part 2][3] which is surprising. 

I embeded the videos after the "post" fold for convenient watching.
