(tldr;) use [PDF to
Keynote](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/freesoftware/pdftokeynote.html) to convert a tex presentation for convenient presenting.

I did have a presentation on my PhDs topic last week.  Took me some
collecting data from recent paper drafts and old slides to create
something polished.

As you would expect I prepared the presentation in [beamer latex](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer).  I found the [metropolis template](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) to my liking.

Great was my shock as the slides would show up blurry in full screen -
well for the first second - and then "jump" to nicely rendered.  I
tried in Preview as well as Skim. They would render nicely but still
slow in Acrobat Reader - however I don't like that one.

On the last day I found my lifesaver: [PDF to
Keynote](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/freesoftware/pdftokeynote.html).
Not only would it transfer my slides into sharp images,  I then could
also use the fancy Keynote controls and the moderator screen for
notes.
