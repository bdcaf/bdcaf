At the current [HUMBLE INDIE BUNDLE 19][1] they
include the party game [Keep talking and nobody explodes][2].  One can get it the next 10
days for about 5â‚¬.  Basically one sits in front of the computer which
simulates a bomb, the rest of the group has the bomb manual and is not
allowed to see the bomb.  They need to talk the one on the bomb trough
defusal.

I couldn't resist.  Looking forward to try it at the next party.
Before I was watching some Youtube videos and it looks great fun.
