I was quite happy to find the graphical tool
[publii](https://getpublii.com/) for building statical sites.

Many people still use Wordpress and the like to publish their blog.  I
don't like Wordpress as it requires to run PHP on the server meaning
it offers a quite large attack surface.  

I prefer the static site approach.   This also allows to radically cut
down on JavaScript and other external resources and gives me
the peace of mind that I don't need to worry about updating a
Wordpress installation.

However the tool of
my choice, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a bit technical.   Now with
[publii](https://getpublii.com/) there is something that I might
suggest command line muggles.
