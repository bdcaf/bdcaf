title: Nice stuff from uibk
---

As I was checking whether the uibk would offer us some storage for
[git](https://git-scm.com) projects I was positively surprised they run
a full [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com) instance.

Unfortunately we will be limited to 50 projects - so I will not be able
to abandon my bitbucket account.  Anyway nice to be able to host
potentially sensitive stuff internal.

Also they run
[mattermost](https://mattermost.uibk.ac.at/breath-research/channels/town-square)
- now that looks very interesting.  Chatting without going through american
services... Need to get my friends in there.
