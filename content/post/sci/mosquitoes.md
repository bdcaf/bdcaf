There is an interesting paper on Mosquitoes from Raji et. al. ("Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes Detect Acidic Volatiles Found in Human Odor Using the IR8a Pathway", doi: [10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.045](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.045)).
It deals with how mosquitoes track their human targets.  They identify three ranges -  at furthest they track by CO<sub>2</sub>,  in mid-range by IR and at closest they zoom in on particular VOCs.

I'm working on project [KIRAS](https://www.uibk.ac.at/breath-research/projects/kiras/kiras-2016.html) now for some time,  and we essentially also need to track humans. It seems our machine learning algorithm has a similar approach (although we do not use IR).  But CO<sub>2</sub> is more dominant in large containers,  while in smaller other compounds play greater role.
