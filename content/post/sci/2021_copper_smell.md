Just recently I found an interesting answer to the question "Why can we smell copper?" on the [chemistry stackexchange][cse].


<!--more-->

Although I was working on breath, this might also explain some of the compounds observed in breath. 

Most compounds that can be smelt have an odor threshold in the ppm range. 
The smell of metals is very well known and often experienced.
Despite this - metals are solid so it's implausible that there would be significant in inhaled air.

The answer is interesting - it's the result of a reaction of the compounds on the skin with the metal (the [nature summary][nature] calls it kind of body odor).
An effect that we rarely consider.
The most prominent product appears to be [Oct-1-en-3-one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oct-1-en-3-one).

The interesting papers are: 
 * [A 'metallic' smell is just body odour][nature]
 * [The Two Odors of Iron when Touched or Pickled:(Skin) Carbonyl Compounds andOrganophosphines][iron]
