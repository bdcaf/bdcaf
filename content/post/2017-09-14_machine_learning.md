There was another funny device in my area of research:
[Nigerian creates device that can detect explosives and
cancer
cells](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/28/africa/koniku-kore-tedglobal/index.html).
Uses #machine-learning and #neurons - all unreliable stuff.
And of course untested sensors.  Though the _real_ neurons
are a new addition.

Though it can't be worse than FAIMS.  It is surprising
that there is a active research group in Nigeria
working.  They keep producing interesting ideas like

Anyway lets close with this nice tweet.
