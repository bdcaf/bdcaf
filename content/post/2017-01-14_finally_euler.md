title: After three months finally an Euler result again
---
Having spent three months on a problem I finally managed to
sufficiently solve [Problem
110](https://projecteuler.net/problem=110).  Strange how problems
change once you work on *huge* numbers.

But now I can again proudly present my score
<a href="https://projecteuler.net"><img
src="https://projecteuler.net/profile/cager.png", alt="Project Euler
Score"/></a>.
Nicely this puts me in the statistics of active ones on place 19 in
Austria.
