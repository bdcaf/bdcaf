Just recently got my hand on
[Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com/products/crossover-mac).  It's
essentially the commercially supported [wine](https://www.winehq.org). 
I am impressed how polished things feel nowadays.  I
gave it usually *problematic* scientific programs like the TofDaqViewer from
Ionicon and the Nist library and it produced nicely running libraries.

Any how I should note that for TofDaqViewer one needs to mark the
checkbox that it should end its recorder process.
