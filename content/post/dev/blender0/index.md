Having some downtime I watched some tutorials for [blender](https://www.blender.org).

It feels like a  powerful tool.  However the long wait for rendering is annoying.  
I particularly like the physics simulations.
As test I followed the this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/YFmN7eTNfNw).  Really simple - just the render took over an hour.

Anyway enjoy some nice wood chipping.
