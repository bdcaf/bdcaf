Just got back from Dornbirn and the paper is sent off for review.
So I got some time at hand and can checkout [atom](https://atom.io) again.
My workhorse was vim - and although I generally feel empowered using it in larger projects I would prefer a more user-friendly organization.

So back it was - turns out I had still some preferences for atom in my home directory.  
The list of installed packages would load forever - so I decided to dump everything.

As starter I set up an environment for latex.  As I was working on some files I still remember the problems and got thngs installed.  I ended up needing *atom-latex*, *language-latex*, *linter-chktex* and *linter-spell-latex*.  Also had to install *hunspell* in homebrew. Now the files would show up reasonable, and even give useful linting suggestions.  Though I miss the grammar suggestions from *writegood* and *redpen*.

The thing I miss most in editing is manipulating text objects. And I see nothing equivalent.  Navigating with keyboard thing is more clunky as I need to move over to the arrows. Ah well I have now a pdf preview inline.
