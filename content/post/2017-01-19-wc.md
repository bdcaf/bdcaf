title: Publication word cloud
---

I wanted to play with word clouds for some time. Usually the problem
is to obtain a nice corpus.  Luckily
[PubMedWordCloud](https://felixfan.github.io/PubMedWordcloud/) was
recently updated and I had something to play with. 

The initial cloud looks not good enough - I did not like how plurals
are counted separately. 
Since I couldn't clean it up easy enough I ended up going back to the
[tm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html) package
and roll my own script.  Unfortunately it's far from publishable.

Anyway the result is way more to my liking.

My final script looks like this - I still use `getAbstracts` from
`PubMedWordCloud`.

``` r 
library(PubMedWordcloud)  
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)
library(magrittr)

pmids <- getPMIDs(author="Clemens Ager",dFrom=2002,dTo=2016,n=30)

abstracts <- getAbstracts(pmids)
corp <- VCorpus(VectorSource(abstracts))

f <- content_transformer(function(x, pattern) gsub(pattern, "", x))
c1 <- tm_map(corp, removePunctuation) %>% 
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>% 
  tm_map(content_transformer(tolower)) %>% 
  tm_map(content_transformer(function(x) gsub("([^si])s\\>", "\\1", x))) %>% 
  tm_map(removeWords, stopwords("english")) %>%
  tm_map(removeWords, c("also", "thus", "three", "calu", "hbepc", "gcm", "ptrm")) %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace) %>%
  tm_map(f, "\\<[[:alpha:]]{,2}\\>\\W+")


wordcloud(c1, random.order=F, min.freq = 6, 
		  colors = brewer.pal(9,"Set1"),
		  rot.per= 0.3)
```


I already have some ideas on where to improve - basically I could
crawl our pdfs as well.  But for today I'm done.
