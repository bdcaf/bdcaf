title: Publication word cloud
---

I wanted to play with word clouds for some time. Usually the problem
is to obtain a nice corpus.  Luckily
[PubMedWordCloud](https://felixfan.github.io/PubMedWordcloud/) was
recently updated and I had something to play with. 

The initial cloud looks not good enough - I did not like how plurals
are counted separately. 
Since I couldn't clean it up easy enough I ended up going back to the
[tm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html) package
and roll my own script.  Unfortunately it's far from publishable.

Anyway the result is way more to my liking.
