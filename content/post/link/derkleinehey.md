I had a dental operation and have problems articulating.  I recalled
learning with "Der kleine Hey". I  couldn't locate it in my library.
I was positively surprised it's in the public domain by now.  The 1884
edition is on [archive.org: Deutscher Gesangs-Unterricht; Lehrbuch des
sprachlichen und gesanglichen
Vortrags](https://archive.org/details/deutschergesangs01heyj).  It's
well worth checking out if you want to work on your (German)
pronunciation.  Now - let's see how soon I can talk again.
