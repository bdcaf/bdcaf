I probably mentioned I use git for managing my code.  Even in the
simplistic way I know - already helpful.   Like in this [xkcd][1]
[![xkcd comic](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)][1]   It
is not easy finding good exercises to improve.

I got pointed to
[learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org).  It looks
polished and the exercises are short enough to do between.  Just
somehow I overlooked the commandos `reset` and `undo` to restart the
exercised.
