title: ERJ accepted correspondence
---

Nice the [ERJ](http://erj.ersjournals.com) has accepted our
correspondence about the future of respiratory medicine.  Hope I will
have the link soon.  

Unfortunately I had extremely limited room to address the statistical
issues.  Anyway writing this correspondence was a pleasant experience.
Really hope we will have more to say soon.
