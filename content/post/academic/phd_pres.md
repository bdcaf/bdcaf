I finally had a presentation on my PhD topic.  This was one of the
more strenous tasks.  Last time I prepared for such a seminar
coincided with [Prof. Amanns death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Amann).  I then put it off for some time.

So this time I had plenty of new data.  But also some new insights I
wanted like to present.  

Here's a cleaned up version based on comments I got after the
presentation.
