The last days brought two papers with playful topics.

- [Digital Nose Stimulation Enables Smelling in Stereo (IEEE)][1]
- [Mammals can breathe through anus in emergencies (phys.org)][2]

<!--more-->

The most interesting in the [first paper][1] is not the stereo-smelling (which
I doubt works this way), but rather the method to create such sensations
electronically.  

The [second paper][2] definitely might be therapeutically useful.  Still the
title just seems to absurd.
