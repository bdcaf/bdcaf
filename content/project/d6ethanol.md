title: Metabolization of deuterated ethanol
---

Although deuterated molecules appear in nature the full deuteration
appear only at practically non-detectable level.  These molecules are
therefore not of endogenous origin.  Considering safety deuterium is
not radioactive and behaves chemically like regular hydrogene.

Despite the metabolic pathway for ethanol degradation being well understood its
parameter are not easy to measure.  The main reason is that these
pathways are also permanently active in other metabolic contexts.
Therefore observing deuterated molecules not appearing in nature and
their metabolites is a promising method for observation.
