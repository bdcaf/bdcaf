(&amp;ldquo;Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes Detect Acidic Volatiles Found in Human Odor Using the IR8a Pathway&amp;rdquo;, doi:

It deals with how mosquitoes track their human targets. They identify three ranges - at furthest they track by CO&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub>, in mid-range by IR and at closest they zoom in on particular VOCs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m working on project
&lt;a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/breath-research/projects/kiras/kiras-2016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KIRAS&lt;/a> now for some time, and we essentially also need to track humans. It seems our machine learning algorithm has a similar approach (although we do not use IR). But CO&lt;sub>2&lt;/sub> is more dominant in large containers, while in smaller other compounds play greater role.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
