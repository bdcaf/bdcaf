venice. The shit faced spin seemed like a good idea. It means one of
the main actors had to drink before and during the show and was given
some leeway in their role. There is a mistress of ceremony that
provides the actor some drinks during the show and takes care things
don&amp;rsquo;t go out of hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It didn&amp;rsquo;t play out that well. A little slapstick was fun. Humour is
more than cursing on stage - it just is not that outstanding - maybe
for Americans. Anyway the fooling around and raunchy got boring
quickly. The play itself is a bit of a complicated choice - being so
anti-Semitic. They always stayed on the political correct side
though. I just was hoping on a more modern interpretation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Day of the cursed child</title><link>/post/2017/2017-07-17_cursed_child/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2017 10:55:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>/post/2017/2017-07-17_cursed_child/</guid><description>Finally got enough time to see Harry Potter and the cursed child. It&amp;rsquo;s quite the investment to have two plays on a day. Anyway finally seeing how it goes on.</description></item></channel></rss>
