      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days I saw the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shit-facedshakespeare.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;shitfaced shakespeares&lt;/a&gt; merchant of
venice.   The shit faced spin seemed like a good idea.  It means one of
the main actors had to drink before and during the show and was given
some leeway in their role.  There is a mistress of ceremony that
provides the actor some drinks during the show and takes care things
don&amp;rsquo;t go out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t play out that well.  A little slapstick was fun. Humour is
more than cursing on stage - it just is not that outstanding - maybe
for Americans.  Anyway the fooling around and raunchy got boring
quickly.  The play itself is a bit of a complicated choice - being so
anti-Semitic.  They always stayed on the political correct side
though.  I just was hoping on a more modern interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally got enough time to see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.harrypottertheplay.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harry Potter and the cursed
child&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s quite the
investment to have two plays on a day.  Anyway finally
seeing how it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
