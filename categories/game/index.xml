      <description>These days I started up Kerbal Space Program. It is a space game where you construct your own vehicles and explore the solar system. As physics games go it is amazing.
Unless you carefully plan out maneuvers they will lead to disaster - which is often also hilarious to watch play out. Even getting into orbit is a challenge in the beginning.
