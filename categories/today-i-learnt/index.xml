Even in the
simplistic way I know - already helpful. Like in this
&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xkcd&lt;/a>
&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" alt="xkcd comic">&lt;/a> It
is not easy finding good exercises to improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got pointed to
&lt;a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learngitbranching&lt;/a>. It looks
polished and the exercises are short enough to do between. Just
somehow I overlooked the commandos &lt;code>reset&lt;/code> and &lt;code>undo&lt;/code> to restart the
exercised.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Github pages</title><link>/post/todayilearnt/2018-move/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 10:49:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>/post/todayilearnt/2018-move/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now this site is on
&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github pages&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
I had already repos on github for some time and trusted it - only
private repos I keep on other places. But mostly I was
missing some features a bplaced so now the move. Mostly I like that I
can now post new content via git so I just need to transfer new posts
and not the whole site. That now the site is &lt;code>https&lt;/code> secured is a
nice boon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me some time to reconfigure my
&lt;a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hugo&lt;/a> blog for the pages here&amp;rsquo;s what I learnt:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the name of the repo must be &lt;code>username.github.io&lt;/code> - at first I had
the impression &lt;code>username&lt;/code> was enough, and also some guides would
describe how to use gitlab instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for me github insists publishing the &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch - so I had to
juggle around, the previous master got renamed to hugo doing: &lt;code>git branch -m master hugo&lt;/code>. I had already ignored the &lt;code>public&lt;/code>
directory, and had to delete the original master from online and
recreate it empty - but I think one can streamline that.
Then added the master using worktree in public: &lt;code>git worktree add -B master public origin/master&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the url in &lt;code>config.toml&lt;/code> should be &lt;code>https://username.github.io/&lt;/code> -
notice the trailing slash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I can then use the &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> command to build my site. And publish
using &lt;code>cd public; git add . ; git commit -am pub; git push; cd ..&lt;/code> - I&amp;rsquo;m in
&lt;a href="https://fishshell.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fish&lt;/a> - many others use &lt;code>&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code> instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I tried putting my binaries under &lt;code>git lfs&lt;/code> - so far it seems to
work. I will write back in case anything shows up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It takes a minute till the change shows up. So I need to be
patient.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So there we are on github now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
