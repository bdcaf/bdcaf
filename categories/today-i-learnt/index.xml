      <description>I probably mentioned I use git for managing my code. Even in the simplistic way I know - already helpful. Like in this xkcd  It is not easy finding good exercises to improve.
I got pointed to learngitbranching. It looks polished and the exercises are short enough to do between. Just somehow I overlooked the commandos reset and undo to restart the exercised.</description>

      <description>Now this site is on github pages.
I had already repos on github for some time and trusted it - only private repos I keep on other places. But mostly I was missing some features a bplaced so now the move. Mostly I like that I can now post new content via git so I just need to transfer new posts and not the whole site. That now the site is https secured is a nice boon.</description>
