I started reworking the layout using the new practices I learnt.
Hope they will still work fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular I found the videos by Jen Simmons inspiring.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I came up with some scripts to clean up tags.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Github pages</title><link>/post/todayilearnt/2018-move/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 10:49:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>/post/todayilearnt/2018-move/</guid><description>Now this site is on github pages.
I had already repos on github for some time and trusted it - only private repos I keep on other places. But mostly I was missing some features a bplaced so now the move. Mostly I like that I can now post new content via git so I just need to transfer new posts and not the whole site. That now the site is https secured is a nice boon.</description></item><item><title>Move from uibk home pages</title><link>/post/2017/2017-07-14_uibkexodus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2017 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>/post/2017/2017-07-14_uibkexodus/</guid><description>So the university is shutting down the personal home pages. Well it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal, though it was helpful that there was a server that would accept ssh connections.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with the free tier of bplaced. Which is basic but should suffice for my plain text pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
