&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002mdl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast about pheromones&lt;/a>. Too bad they don&amp;rsquo;t offer transcripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pheromones in breath would be most interesting however it is still in debate whether human pheromones exist at all.&lt;br>
