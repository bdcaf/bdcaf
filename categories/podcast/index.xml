Too bad they don&amp;rsquo;t offer transcripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pheromones in breath would be most interesting however it is still in debate whether human pheromones exist at all.&lt;br>
But there was the discovery of rabbit mammary pheromone by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01739">Schaal et al&lt;/a>. And the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2890510/">darcin pheromone in mice&lt;/a>.
I did learn that some animals also have another organ related to smell - the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal_organ">vomeronasal organ (Jacobson&amp;rsquo;s organ)&lt;/a>. It seems to be also present in humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately our tech still doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform to well at the relevant masses, though that is an most interesting research area.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
